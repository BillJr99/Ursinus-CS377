excerpt: "CS377: Database Design - The Structured Query Language (SQL)"

info:
  goals: 
    - To use the SQL language to query and manipulate a database
    - To integrate common programming constructs with SQL language
    - To use a prepared statement to sanitize program inputs used in a SQL query

      title: Python SQL Programming
      questions:
        - "Create a class to encapsulate the behavior of a SQL Query."
        - "Discuss with your group a potential data model and draw a schema for that model.  As a class, create the database in SQL, and then implement it with your Python program."
        - "What are the primary keys, foreign keys, kernels, and dependencies in your data model?  For each dependency, what kind of dependency is it?"

      title: "Sanitizing Database Inputs"
      questions:
        - What is the problem being demonstrated here?  How might you write a program that is vulnerable to this type of attack?
        - "What can we do to prevent this?"
        - "Look up a SQL Prepared Statement and write down how to execute one in your favorite programming language and library."

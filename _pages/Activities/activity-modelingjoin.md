excerpt: "CS377: Database Design - Data Modeling and the Join"

info:
  goals: 
    - To model table joins
    - To differentiate between the different type of joins
    - To implement table joins in SQL and programmatically
    - To identify potential anomalies in data schemas
    - To take steps to normalize data schemas to avoid anomalies

      questions:
        - "What data redundancies do you see in this table, and how can you fix each?"
        - "How would you change the address of a bank?  Remove a bank?  Insert a new account an an existing back, but with an updated address?  These are <strong>update anomalies</strong>, <strong>deletion anomalies</strong>, and <strong>insertion anomalies</strong>."
        - "Design a schema that eliminates data redundancy in this table."

      title: Case Study
      questions:
        - "Induce as many anomalies as you can in the flawed table above!"
        - "How does the improved (<strong>normalized</strong>) schema help prevent the anomalies you were able to create?"

      title: The SQL Join
      questions:
        - "Joins are classified by which records are included if a corresponding match is not found in one table.  An <strong>inner join</strong> includes only records that match across both tables.  A <strong>left outer</strong> join includes all rows from the first table and their corresponding match from the second table (or <code>NULL</code> if no match exists from the second table.  What do you think a <strong>right outer join is</strong>, and a <strong>full outer join</strong>?"
        - "What records are included in an inner join, a left outer join, a right outer join, and a full outer join, for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Join_(SQL)\">this data table</a>?  Write the SQL <code>JOIN</code> statements required to implement each join by linking the <code>DepartmentID</code> column."

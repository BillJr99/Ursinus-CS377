      title: Kernels and Existence-Dependent (Weak) Entities
      questions:
        - "Why might the <code>DEPENDENTS</code> table be called a weak dependency?  Can it exist by itself?"
        - "What other weak dependencies do you see in the schema?"
        - "What <strong>independent entites</strong> (having no dependencies on other entity existence), or <strong>kernels</strong>, exist in this database?"
        - "Is every dependency a weak dependency?  What might an example be of a non-weak dependency?"
        - "On the <code>INSERT</code> line into <code>DEPENDENTCOVERAGE</code>, what does <code>last_insert_rowid()</code> refer to?  What is the corresponding ID from the lookup of last_insert_rowid(), and what are we doing with it?" 
        - "Why doesn't the <code>DEPENDENTCOVERAGE</code> table have an <code>EmployeeID</code> attribute (&quot;field&quot;), when it would be helpful with those subsequent insertions."
        - "Write a program to perform these insertions into this sqlite database, using a loop to iterate over all of an employee's dependents when inserting into <code>DEPENDENTCOVERAGE</code>."
        - "What would it mean if a foreign key did not exist in the primary table?  This is called a violation of <strong>referential integrity</strong>."

      title: Derived Entities
      questions:
        - "What are the kernels in this schema?"
        - "What is the purpose of the <code>ENROLLMENTS</code> table?  What does it connect?"
        - "<code>ENROLLMENTS</code> is an example of a <strong>derived entity</strong>; describe what you think this means in your own words."
        - "Using <a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/ERAlchemy/\">ERAlchemy</a>, generate a schema diagram from the example below."

      title: Characteristic Entities
      questions:
        - "Design a relationship that features a kernel table for people with basic personal information, and a connection to zero or more email addresses.  You can't have infinitely many columns in your kernel table, so you will need a second table.  This relationship is called a <strong>characteristic entity</strong>."

## Written Assignment

Complete Exercises 1, 2, 5, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 16, 17 in Chapter 16 of the Database Design textbook.

These exercises use the Microsoft Northwind Pubs database.  The SQLite version of this database is not apparently available for download.  As a result, I have converted the files for you here \[[^1]\]:

- [pubs.sqlite](../files/mspubs/pubs.sqlite) file for inserting into a Sqlite program
- [pubs.db](../files/mspubs/pubs.db) file for use with a Pythong sqlite3 library program
- [pubs.pdf](../files/mspubs/pubs.pdf) schema description

You may implement your answers to these questions using either SQL statements, or a program with a SQL library (or a combination of the two).

## Exporting your Project for Submission

When you're done, write a README for your project, and save all your files, before exporting your project to ZIP.  In your README, answer any bolded questions presented on this page.

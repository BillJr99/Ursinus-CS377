  flexible_submission_policy: "In the absence of <a href=\"#accommodations\">accommodations</a> arranged in advance with the instructor or college, all assignments are due at 10:59PM Eastern Time on the date(s) stated on the schedule.  Assignments will be accepted without prior permission following this time with a points deduction of 4% per day if submitted before 10:59 PM Eastern Time on the day submitted.  Each student will receive a total of 10 &quot;slack days&quot; for the semester with which to waive these grade reductions; for example, one assignment may be submitted 10 days late, or two assignments may be submitted 5 days late, with no grade reduction.  Should an exemption to this policy be requested and granted, a 5% per day reduction will be applied.  Extra credit will not be awarded for assignments submitted under the flexible submission policy.  Students with accommodations will receive additional &quot;slack days&quot; as specified within the accommodations letter; however, some deliverables cannot be subject to accommodations due to the time-sensitive nature of the assignment (for example, group assignments, presentations, and course surveys).  Students who add the class late shall receive additional slack days equal to the number of days between the start of classes and the first date that approval is given or that class is attended (whichever occurs first).  Under no circumstances (including accommodations) can late work be accepted after the final class meeting, nor during final exams week, nor after the exam."

## Overview
Welcome to CS377: Database Design!  In this course, we will explore models for storing, organizing, indexing, searching, transmitting, and scaling data to make it useful for humans and computers to extract efficiently and effectively.  We will explore these fundamental concepts of databases and understand why they are an essential component of modern computing systems. Databases are widely used to store, manage, and retrieve vast amounts of structured data efficiently. Whether it is for a small business or a large enterprise, understanding databases is crucial for making informed decisions about data storage and retrieval processes.

### What is a Database?
A database is an organized collection of data, typically stored and accessed electronically. It consists of structured data, such as tables, records, and fields, which can be manipulated and queried using a database management system (DBMS). Databases provide a structured and efficient way to store, retrieve, update, and analyze data.

#### Relational Databases
Relational databases are the most common type of database used in modern systems. They organize data in tables, where each table consists of rows (records) and columns (fields). The relationships between tables are established through keys, such as primary keys and foreign keys. The SQL (Structured Query Language) is widely used for interacting with relational databases.

#### NoSQL Databases
NoSQL (Not Only SQL) databases have gained popularity due to their ability to handle unstructured and semi-structured data efficiently. Unlike relational databases, NoSQL databases do not require a predefined schema and can handle large amounts of data with high scalability and performance. Examples of NoSQL databases include MongoDB, Cassandra, and Redis.

### Why Use Databases?
Databases offer various benefits that make them indispensable in modern computing systems. Here are some of the key reasons for using databases:

1. Data Persistence: Databases provide a reliable method for long-term data storage, ensuring data durability and availability even in the face of hardware or software failures.

2. Data Integrity: Databases enforce data integrity by defining constraints and rules that ensure the validity and consistency of the stored data. This helps maintain data quality and accuracy.

3. Data Security: Databases offer mechanisms to control access to data, ensuring that only authorized users can view or modify sensitive information. Security features include user authentication, role-based access control, and encryption.

4. Data Efficiency: Databases enable efficient storage and retrieval of data by optimizing internal data structures and query processing algorithms. This leads to faster response times and improved system performance.

## Homework

### Labs
Approximately every week, we will have a lab session where students get a chance to practice concepts we just learned in a safe and [collaborative](#collaboration) environment. Tasks will be given that serve as warm-ups for the larger assignments, and you will have a chance to refine your submissions as you practice.

### Assignments
The bulk of the grade in the course will be earned by completing individual programming assignments. Be sure to start them early! Note that [collaboration and sharing rules](#collaboration) differ slightly for labs and assignments.

## Classroom Participation

### Group Work \[[^1]\]
In addition to ordinary participation that follows the natural rhythm of a lecture, most days there will be at least one followup problem, which is a question that follows on the heels of newly presented material. Students will split into groups of 2 and try to write some code to address a particular problem. When a group of students believe they have figured out the answer, they raise their hand. The other students can continue to work while I verify that the answer is correct. If the answer is correct, the students present the answer to the class. If the group is not correct upon my checking, then the groups continue this process until one gets it correct.

Other ways to help your fellow classmates in class are as follows:

* Helping to teach a student a topic during office hours.
* Certain calls for participation in class
* Particularly helpful or insightful messages on Microsoft Teams
* Finding mistakes in the book or on the assigned homework and labs

### Class Participation and Classroom Etiquette \[[^1]\]
For classroom attendance, the following rules apply:

* Please be attentive during class. There will be class exercises that involve coding, but class time should be used for learning computer science. It is imperative that technology be used for this purpose during our class time together. **Alternatively, please try to think of this as a safe space away from social media.** We could all use a break, and we are fortunate to have a good excuse to make that space.
* Please follow common courtesy. For instance, you can bring food and drink as long as it's not distracting, but please clean up after yourself if you do. Our janitorial staff deserves the utmost respect and help with their job.
* In-class exercises and "low stakes" activities will take place individually and in groups to assess our progress together.  These exercises will be given both synchronously (for example, in-class activities, pair programming exercises) and asynchronously (for example, pre-lab exercises, peer code reviews, book surveys) and will be graded on a participation basis.  These are given equal weight and form the basis of the class participation score.
* If a class session is remote, please feel free to make choices that make you most comfortable.  For example, I will record these sessions for students who cannot make the session or for those who would benefit from a review of the material.  I'd encourage you to enable your video feed if it is available, but if you need leave your video off, you feel free to do so; however, if you find that this becomes necessary on a prolonged basis, please see me to discuss.  Please keep your microphone on mute to avoid background noises while others are speaking; however, please do not feel "mic fright" about unmuting to speak up and participate anytime.  If, however, you would prefer to communicate via the chat interface (either exclusively or in combination with your audio/video), you should feel free to do that.  Whether in-person or remote, all I ask is that you engage as best you can; the material is challenging but fun, and we're all here to learn new things together.

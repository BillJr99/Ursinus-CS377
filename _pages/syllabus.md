## Overview
Welcome to CS377: Database Design!  In this course, we will explore models for storing, organizing, indexing, searching, transmitting, and scaling data to make it useful for humans and computers to extract efficiently and effectively. 

## Homework

### Labs
Approximately every week, we will have a lab session where students get a chance to practice concepts we just learned in a safe and [collaborative](#collaboration) environment. Tasks will be given that serve as warm-ups for the larger assignments, and you will have a chance to refine your submissions as you practice.

### Assignments
The bulk of the grade in the course will be earned by completing individual programming assignments. Be sure to start them early! Note that [collaboration and sharing rules](#collaboration) differ slightly for labs and assignments.

## Classroom Participation

### Group Work \[[^1]\]
In addition to ordinary participation that follows the natural rhythm of a lecture, most days there will be at least one followup problem, which is a question that follows on the heels of newly presented material. Students will split into groups of 2 and try to write some code to address a particular problem. When a group of students believe they have figured out the answer, they raise their hand. The other students can continue to work while I verify that the answer is correct. If the answer is correct, the students present the answer to the class. If the group is not correct upon my checking, then the groups continue this process until one gets it correct.

Other ways to help your fellow classmates in class are as follows:

* Helping to teach a student a topic during office hours.
* Certain calls for participation in class
* Particularly helpful or insightful messages on Microsoft Teams
* Finding mistakes in the book or on the assigned homework and labs

### Class Participation and Classroom Etiquette \[[^1]\]
For classroom attendance, the following rules apply:

* Please be attentive during class. There will be class exercises that involve coding, but class time should be used for learning computer science. It is imperative that technology be used for this purpose during our class time together. **Alternatively, please try to think of this as a safe space away from social media.** We could all use a break, and we are fortunate to have a good excuse to make that space.
* Please follow common courtesy. For instance, you can bring food and drink as long as it's not distracting, but please clean up after yourself if you do. Our janitorial staff deserves the utmost respect and help with their job.
* In-class exercises and "low stakes" activities will take place individually and in groups to assess our progress together.  These exercises will be given both synchronously (for example, in-class activities, pair programming exercises) and asynchronously (for example, pre-lab exercises, peer code reviews, book surveys) and will be graded on a participation basis.  These are given equal weight and form the basis of the class participation score.
* If a class session is remote, please feel free to make choices that make you most comfortable.  For example, I will record these sessions for students who cannot make the session or for those who would benefit from a review of the material.  I'd encourage you to enable your video feed if it is available, but if you need leave your video off, you feel free to do so; however, if you find that this becomes necessary on a prolonged basis, please see me to discuss.  Please keep your microphone on mute to avoid background noises while others are speaking; however, please do not feel "mic fright" about unmuting to speak up and participate anytime.  If, however, you would prefer to communicate via the chat interface (either exclusively or in combination with your audio/video), you should feel free to do that.  Whether in-person or remote, all I ask is that you engage as best you can; the material is challenging but fun, and we're all here to learn new things together.
